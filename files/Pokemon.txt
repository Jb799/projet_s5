I wanna be the very best
like no one ever was
to catch them is my real test
to train them is my cause
I will travel across the land
searching far and wide
its pokemon to understand
the power that's inside


(pokemon gotta catch 'em all)
It's you and me
I know it's my destiny
(pokemon)
ooh your my best friend
in a world we must defend
(pokemon gotta catch 'em all)
our hearts are true
our courage will pull us through
you teach me and I'll teach you
pokemon!
(gotta catch'em all)
gotta catch 'em all!

Yeah

every challenge along the way
with courage I will face
I will battle every day
to claim my rightful place
come with me the time is right
there's no better team
arm in arm we'll win the fight
it's always been our dream
