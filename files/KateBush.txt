It doesn't hurt me
Do you wanna feel how it feels?
Do you wanna know, know that it doesn't hurt me?
Do you wanna hear about the deal that I'm making?
You, it's you and me

And if I only could
I'd make a deal with God
And I'd get him to swap our places
Be running up that road
Be running up that hill
Be running up that building
Say, if I only could, ooh

You don't wanna hurt me
But see how deep the bullet lies
Unaware I'm tearing you asunder
Ooh, there is thunder in our hearts

Is there so much hate for the ones we love?
Oh, tell me, we both matter, don't we?
You, it's you and me
It's you and me won't be unhappy

And if I only could
I'd make a deal with God
And I'd get him to swap our places
Be running up that road
Be running up that hill
Be running up that building
Say, if I only could, ooh

You
It's you and me
It's you and me won't be unhappy

Oh, come on, baby. Oh, come on, darling
Let me steal this moment from you now
Oh, come on, angel. Come on, come on, darling
Let's exchange the experience, ooh

And if I only could
I'd make a deal with God
And I'd get him to swap our places
I'd be running up that road
Be running up that hill
With no problems

Say, if I only could
I'd make a deal with God
And I'd get him to swap our places
Be running up that road
Be running up that hill
With no problems

So if I only could
And make a deal with God
I'd get him to swap our places
I'd be running up that road
Be running up that hill
With no problems

So if I only could
Be running up that hill
With no problems

If I only could, be running up that hill
If I only could, be running up that hill
